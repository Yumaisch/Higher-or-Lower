# Higher-or-Lower
Higher or Lower, a number guessing game.

Hi, I am learning how to code, and this is my first programm that i coded without a tutorital :D 
I would love to get some feedback, i know the code is probably terrible but well it's my first programm ever ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The restart boolean is only there because i am figuring out how to restart the programm when you have lost.

the things I have managed to implement for right now is:

the game,
a score count,
a spelling check
